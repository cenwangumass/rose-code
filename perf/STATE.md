# Performance state

Current state of the work in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md). Rewrite in place; no log (history is `jj log`).

## Numbers

Baseline solver: `8b645007` (same solver as `vlsokskq`). Current solver: `rtyoxnwx` (reserve dense BTRAN result capacity before the row scan).
Parity: full tier 987/987; release tests pass. Three timed runs after one warm-up, hyperfine 2.0.0; instruction counts are millions from perf stat.

`baseline wall` is the fixed initial process-wall median. `paired base wall` is the fresh baseline-binary median from alternating baseline/last-landed/candidate checks on one CPU (CPU 0 unless stated otherwise); it resolves host drift without changing the fixed baseline. `current wall` and `solve` use the new harness; **current/ref uses solve-only time**, `diagnostics.seconds`, against original Gurobi Runtime.

Reference provenance: original-library cached records `../reverse-engineer/runs/{degen2,degen3,perold,pilot4}-{profile}.json` for the ten previously valid cells. New three-run medians use `/tmp/rose-perf-reference/{primal_5959.primal-r,primal_5959.dual-r,quad_2717.dual-r,fx_quad_obj_5371.dual-r}.{1,2,3}.json`; summary `/tmp/rose-perf-reference/summary.json`. All original-library records identify Ryzen 9 5900X and library SHA256 `8e87fca221fdffc922331c8619426031b3e72dfd419446422f88af0cb0e98f9c`.
`-` refs are unreachable: original Gurobi rejects 80BAU3B, GREENBEA and mode-switch with license error 10010 (scratch `ID.error.json`, including direct 80BAU3B primal/dual attempts). The old 80BAU3B primal/dual refs used the patched library and have been removed; the old prose mode-switch time is unusable.

Regression checks: all 23 runs paired against the preceding solver on CPU 4, with pair order alternating by run. An 80BAU3B barrier timing increase needed alternating CPU-2 follow-ups; it resolves to solve 0.374202 -> 0.367868 s within paired spreads, with essentially unchanged instructions. Every remaining increase is within its paired min-max spread. No unresolved fixed-baseline regression: 80BAU3B barrier is below its fresh paired baseline wall; GREENBEA barrier and both PDHG runs remain within their fixed/fresh baseline bands. Raw data `target/perf-btout-full-{before,after}.txt` and `target/perf-btout-followup-{before,after}.txt`. Host speed varies substantially; use immediate pairs and spreads.
Acceptance: CPU-2 DEGEN3 primal-release solve 1.146248 -> 1.133791 s (-1.1%; spreads 0.002341/0.001940 s), instructions 6520.5 -> 6506.6M (-0.21%) (`target/perf-btout-target-{before,after}.txt`). The full sweep corroborates the instruction decrease (-0.22%); its solve 0.736800 -> 0.734179 s is inside the wider 0.003651/0.008025 s spreads. Dense BTRAN emits at most one result per row and now reserves m slots before scanning rows, avoiding repeated vector growth. Arithmetic, selection, row order, WORK bookings and dumps stay unchanged; full parity 987/987 and release tests pass.

## Hotspots

Per profiled bench run: the commit it was taken at and the top self-time functions (percent), at most
five lines each. Re-profile a run when a landed change touched its hot path.

- perold.dual-r, `vsxqqkwy` (stale after dense slot counting; frame-pointer build passes full 987/987 parity; ten solves capped at 1300 iterations, `target/perf-perold-rest.data`): FTRAN 8.75%, update 8.05%, iteration 7.63%, ftran_needed 6.42%, LU nucleus 5.89% self; L stage 5.72%. Integer slot sorting remains 1.80% in small-sort networks plus 1.25% in quicksort. All ten optimal in 1273 iterations, 27 refactorizations. Large dense slot lists now use reusable counts and a descending slot scan; smaller/sparser lists retain comparison sorting. Reprofile before choosing further work.
- perold.primal-c, `yryslslw` (stale after growth-factor reuse and the dense work-count shortcut; frame-pointer build passes full 987/987 parity; three solves capped at 3500 iterations, `target/perf-perold.data`): BTRAN 8.71%, primal control 7.01%, row_product_work 6.39%, update 6.12%, fresh factor 6.10% self. Refactor 26.63%, FTRAN 11.82%, BTRAN 11.03% inclusive. All three optimal in 3399 iterations, 90 refactorizations; original reference also has 3399 iterations. The work-estimator annotation (`target/perf-perold-rowprod-annotate.txt`) attributes substantial time to checks in the touched-row scan; dense counts now avoid that scan. Reprofile before choosing the remaining sparse work.
- degen3.primal-c, `oytzqrpy` (stale after growth-factor reuse; frame-pointer build passes full 987/987 parity; three solves capped at 10000 iterations, `target/perf-degen3c-next.data`): primal control 8.91%, BTRAN 8.09%, FTRAN 6.51%, LU nucleus 5.82%, fresh factor 5.25% self. Refactorization is 31.03%, reference_order_for 19.77%, BTRAN 11.48%, FTRAN 10.88% inclusive; dense BTRAN output compaction is another 2.58% self. All three optimal in 2492 iterations, 49 refactorizations. The accepted growth-check factor now carries through to installation; reprofile before choosing remaining reference-order or BTRAN work.
- degen3.primal-r, `xutnmxks` (stale after dense BTRAN output reservation; frame-pointer build passes full 987/987 parity; three solves capped at 5300 iterations, `target/perf-degen3r-rest.data`): FTRAN 12.37%, BTRAN 7.48%, update 7.08%, LU nucleus 5.90%, primal control 4.73% self. Refactorization is 24.83%, FTRAN 21.75%, BTRAN 11.26% inclusive; dense BTRAN output compaction is 3.45% inclusive/2.88% self. All three optimal in 5165 iterations, 66 refactorizations. FTRAN annotation (`target/perf-degen3r-rest-ftran-annotate.txt`) highlights tail graph traversal, scatter bounds checks and output done/fallback scans; prior dense-FTRAN output simplification was rejected below. Dense BTRAN output now reserves its maximum row count before scanning; reprofile before choosing remaining FTRAN graph, scatter or output work.
- quad_2717.dual-r, `ussxlpst` (stale after native ranked row products; frame-pointer build passes full 987/987 parity; eight solves capped at 17000 iterations, `target/perf-quad-next.data`): F80 add 15.13%, primal control 10.38%, F80 multiply 8.89%, pack 5.06%, rank_products_q 4.22% self. Row products are 13.20%, cost_change_work 12.77%, refactorization 17.26% inclusive. All eight optimal in 16010 iterations, 3022 refactorizations. Ranked row products now use native extended arithmetic under the required control mode; the software kernel remains the fallback. Reprofile before choosing remaining arithmetic or set_d_from_y work. The rejected masks, coefficient cache, distant-exponent shortcut and forced add inlining are listed below.
- degen3.barrier-r, `munmovyt` (stale after kernel dispatch; frame-pointer build passes full parity; three solves capped at 100 iterations, `target/perf-barrier-degen3-valid.data`): FMA dispatch 26.46%, DGEMM 24.62%, existing hardware FMA implementation 14.77%, numeric_factor 7.40%, DTRSM 4.36% self. DGEMM 49.04%, numeric factor 81.45% inclusive; all three solves optimal in 14 iterations. The per-product FMA wrapper is an indirect call plus frame/return overhead (annotated `target/perf-barrier-fma-annotate.txt`); per-call dispatch now removes that per-product overhead without adding fused operations. BORE3D is a cheap witness (16 barrier iterations, 12 ms).
- primal_5959.dual-r, `tplnupps` (stale after factor reuse; frame-pointer build passes full parity; three solves capped at 16000 iterations, `target/perf-dual5959-full.data`): F80 add_signed 7.50%, primal control 5.70%, F80 multiply 4.54%, F80 nucleus 3.88%, double nucleus 3.74% self. All three reach numerical_failure, 15688 iterations, 7842 refactorizations. Refactorization is 51.10% inclusive, quad mirrors 21.69% before factor reuse. LUIN capture `target/perf-dual5959-luin.log` has 7822 records and 40 input-head/threshold combinations; two-entry LRU estimate 99.3% hits. Wide-shift arithmetic rewrites are rejected below. The earlier 11000-iteration capture stopped early and is not the full-run profile.
- pilot4.primal-r, `oqoyqxpq` (stale after on-demand elimination WORK counts; frame-pointer build passes full 987/987 parity; twenty solves capped at 700 iterations, `target/perf-pilot-next2.data`): update 9.97%, FTRAN 7.80%, primal control 7.77%, fresh factor 6.78%, BTRAN 5.55% self. malloc/free total 3.30% self. All twenty optimal in 690 iterations, 16 refactorizations. Update annotation (`target/perf-pilot-next2-update.txt`) puts about 30% of update self samples in the full elimination WORK row-count rebuild, now replaced by on-demand transpose scans. Reprofile before choosing the remaining update work.
- primal_5959.primal-r, `kyyvxyql` (stale after twin reuse; frame-pointer build passes full 987/987 parity; three bounded solves at 1999 Hz, `target/perf-fp-primal5959.data`, report with `--no-inline`): primal control 6.32%, F80 nucleus 5.46%, fresh F80 factor 5.09%, F80 add_signed 6.67% self. Refactor 53.53%, quad mirrors 28.88% inclusive before twin reuse. Log verifies numerical_failure, 10780 iterations, 5381 refactorizations; original reference status 12, 10780 iterations, refactor count unavailable. Default inline expansion duplicates frames; use PLAN.md's validated frame-pointer workflow for caller attribution.
- fx_quad_obj_5371.dual-r, `kyyvxyql` (stale after twin reuse; profiling build, three solves at 1999 Hz, `target/perf-members-fx.data`): F80 add_signed 8.06%, F80 nucleus 5.81%, multiply 5.74%, fresh F80 factor 5.17%, pack 3.83% self cycles. Solve remains infeasible, 5319 iterations, 5 refactorizations.
- degen3.dual-r, `sormxnyt` (stale after metadata caching; frame-pointer build passes full parity; three solves capped at 2300 iterations, `target/perf-btplan-degen3.data`): iteration 13.36%, update 8.89%, L stage 7.68%, BTRAN 7.21%, FTRAN 6.93% self; ftran_needed 5.34%, with the old column-scan filler gone. BTRAN annotation (`target/perf-btplan-btran-annotate.txt`) attributes over a quarter of its self samples to rebuilding transpose levels, and more to rebuilding the inverse row map. L columns, initial row permutation and loff are immutable between refactorizations. All solves optimal in 2212 iterations, 24 refactorizations; original reference also has 2212 iterations.
- mode_switch.dual-r, `xzuktkmx` (stale after F80/LU changes; reprofile before choosing it): update 22.21%, LU nucleus 15.90%, BTRAN 13.33%, fresh-factor row-list filtering 7.67%, factor_structure 3.36% self cycles. Full solve: 11393 iterations, 17 refactorizations.

## In progress

None.

## Candidates

Ordered by current/ref; reprofile any changed path before choosing a change. Ratios use the current
sweep's solve medians; paired old/new times determine whether a change gains or regresses.

- degen2.primal-c (7.65x), perold.dual-r (6.69x), degen2.dual-r (6.31x), degen3.dual-r (5.98x), degen3.barrier-r (5.07x): work in this order. Reprofile changed paths before choosing a change; the latest primal profile is stale after BTRAN output reservation. Host speed bands can reorder these snapshot ratios.
- DEGEN3 dual: tau row-value lookup and immutable BTRAN metadata are settled. Reprofile before inspecting remaining iteration control, updates and scratch allocation.
- Other reachable runs follow their table ratios. Quad twins share construction and four compact repeated factors are cached; row-capacity growth already uses the numeric U transpose.
- Quad_2717: ranked extended row products now use native x87 arithmetic with a software fallback. Reprofile before inspecting remaining F80 arithmetic and set_d_from_y; the old call shares no longer describe the current solver. Cost-change work performs required reduced-cost updates; the factor-cache working set is settled.
- Barrier: profile again before choosing more work. DGEMM now dispatches existing fused operations once per call; other BLAS-like kernels still use their original scalar dispatch and accumulation order. A smaller remaining DGEMM gap may involve independent outputs and data reuse, which must preserve every per-output reduction order.
- Runs without reachable references, after the reachable ratios: mode-switch update (22.21%) still scans A/B lists for other memberships; BTRAN (13.33% before metadata caching) allocates scratch; LU nucleus (15.90%); fresh-factor row-list filtering (7.67%). These old profiles are stale; annotate again before choosing a change.
- all: dump::on/record construction without dumps and allocation in FTRAN/BTRAN, pricing and ratio tests remain unmeasured leads.

## Tried, no gain

- Force-inline existing F80 add/sub: fast parity 940/940 passes, but Quad_2717 instructions +2.1% and solve 0.443852 -> 0.448784 s has no gain; fx_quad instructions +1.1%, solve +3.2%. Reverted (`target/perf-inlineadd-target-{before,after}.txt`).

- Cache immutable extended row-wise coefficients on first use: frozen differential and fast parity 940/940 pass, Quad_2717 instructions -1.3%, but solve 0.708071 -> 0.702991 s is within 0.009744/0.035976 s spreads. Reverted (`target/perf-qcoef-target-{before,after}.txt`).

- Mask unused extended cost-change row products: frozen differential and fast parity 940/940 pass, Quad_2717 instructions -1.4%, but alternating CPU-4 solve 0.701696 -> 0.671770 s is within 0.079075/0.140497 s spreads. Reverted (`target/perf-qmask-recheck-{before,after}.txt`).

- Rebuild all elimination WORK row counts by sequential U-transpose scans: fast parity 940/940 passes and PILOT4 instructions -1.2%, but alternating CPU-4 solve 0.111296 -> 0.116587 s has no gain (spreads 0.009052/0.003302 s). Reverted in favor of on-demand counts (`target/perf-rcountrows-recheck-{before,after}.txt`).

- Emit dense FTRAN output directly without ord/done arrays: fast parity 940/940 passes, but PILOT4 solve 0.073238 -> 0.074108 s and instructions 737.9 -> 738.6M; DEGEN2 timing is within spread. Reverted (`target/perf-denseout-target-{before,after}.txt`).

- Move completed FTRAN x/input buffers into F2 after output construction instead of cloning: fast parity 940/940 passes, PILOT4 instructions 737.8 -> 737.3M (-0.06%), solve 0.073656 -> 0.073330 s is within old 0.000944 s spread; DEGEN2 is within spread and PEROLD changes host bands. Reverted (`target/perf-f2move-target.log`).

- Reuse BTRAN dense x/w buffers: fast parity 940/940 passes, PILOT4 instructions 747.0 -> 745.9M (-0.14%), but solve 0.113494 -> 0.116470 s has no gain (spreads 0.003324/0.002445 s); DEGEN2 is within spread and PEROLD changes host bands with little instruction change. Reverted (`target/perf-btbuf-target.log`).

- Precompute eligibility for row_product_work scans longer than n: fast parity 940/940 passes, PEROLD primal instructions -0.4%, solve 1.342457 -> 1.332925 s is within 0.249063/0.547923 s spreads; DEGEN3 primal-controlled has no timing gain and DEGEN2 instructions rise slightly (`target/perf-rowelig-long-target.log`). Reverted.

- Lazy per-column eligibility memoization in row_product_work: fast parity 940/940 passes, PEROLD primal instructions -1.1%, but CPU-2 solve 1.322285 -> 1.320622 s is within 0.013795 s spread; CPU-0 alternating recheck crosses speed bands with no clear aggregate gain (`target/perf-rowelig-{target,recheck}.log`). Reverted.

- Binary lookup in the U transpose for tau terms: fast parity 940/940 passes; DEGEN3 dual instructions 3769.4 -> 3753.4M (-0.4%), solve 0.739033 -> 0.716611 s is within old 0.025890 s spread. DEGEN2/PEROLD instructions rise slightly. Replaced by direct row-map trial (`target/perf-taulookup-target.log`).
- F80 add aligned with three guard bits, plus direct normal-result rounding: frozen old-add/pack differential test and fast parity 940/940 pass, instructions fall 4977.9 -> 4836.8M (-2.8%), but primal_5959 dual CPU-4 solve 0.555599 -> 0.557742 s (spreads 0.006716/0.011524 s). Alignment alone also has no timing gain on CPUs 2/4 despite -1.7% instructions. Reverted both (`target/perf-add-{target,recheck}.log`, `target/perf-add-direct-{target,recheck}.log`).
- Read eliminate work counts directly from maintained rowl lengths instead of rebuilding counts: parity full 987/987 and release tests pass, but mode_switch.dual-r 22.849 -> 21.851 s is smaller than the old 1.849 s spread (instructions 146886.1 -> 140945.4M, -4.0%). Alternating DEGEN2 primal 0.092/0.090 then 0.091/0.091 s; dual 0.068/0.067 s, marginal against spread. Reverted.

## Tried, breaks parity

(idea, first differing record from `rose-parity check`, why)
